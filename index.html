       Akan names are traditional names from Ghana that are given based on the day of the week a person is born. This naming system comes from the Akan people, one of the largest ethnic groups in Ghana, and reflects a deep connection between identity, culture, and time. Each day of the week is associated with a specific male and female name, and these names are believed to represent certain character traits, values, and spiritual meanings. For example, people born on different days are traditionally thought to share common characteristics such as leadership, creativity, or calmness. Akan naming is more than just a way to identify someone, it is a cultural practice that links individuals to their heritage, family history, and community. Even today, Akan names are widely used both traditionally and alongside modern names, serving as a meaningful reminder of Ghanaian culture and identity. Discover your Akan name based on the day of the week you were born.
